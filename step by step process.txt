STEP 1 (DONE)
=================

Create a list of anime to be used to make a decision, it randomly pick a show from the list.
This only utilizes a list with however many shows you decide and the "random.choice" method. Everytime it is ran, it will 
generate a show.

STEP 2 (DONE)
=================

Of the list, add things such as genre's or general emotions from the show to allow the user to decide what type of show
they could be feeling. This can be done with a list in a list for example:
	[
		[Tokyo Ghoul, Horror, Psychological, Seinen, Action],
		[Eighty Six, Action, Mecha, Drama],
		[Bleach, Action, Shonen]
	]
You can now have a input that asks the user what genre they may want. 
	"What genre do you wish to watch?"
If there are shows with the same genre use a for loop to add all applicable shows into a list and randomly select from those options.

Doing this allows a more centered direction of what the user could want to watch, instead of a
randomly selected a show. 


STEP 2.5 (DONE)
=================

Allow the user to choose multiple genre's to lower the selection of shows, if there are no shows then it must be stated so. 
	"What genre's do you wish to watch? (Use a comma to separate between genres)"
	Input: Action, Horror
	Output: The show "Tokyo Ghoul" seems to match your preferences

STEP 2.75 (DONE)
=================

Instead of randomly selecting a show, ask the user prior to receiving the final output whether they would like to show all options
or have it pick one.
	"What genre's do you wish to watch? (Use a comma to separate between genres)"
	Input: Action
	"Do you wish to showcase all similar options or randomly pick one? (Yes for first, No for second)"
		Input: Yes
		Output: These shows all match the genre you selected
			Bleach, Action, Shonen
			Eighty Six, Action, Mecha, Drama
			Tokyo Ghoul, Horror, Psychological, Seinen, Action
	or
		Input: No
		Output: We have chosen Eighty Six of the shows that matched with the genre's you selected.

===========
Get to here first, once here, there will need to be many more additions, this above is the base version of the project.
===========

STEP 3 (Slightly more advanced) (DONE)
=================

Instead of having a previously set list, utilize the "Jikan" API to access the MAL list of anime that can be watched along
with the genres and whatnot. This will build upon step 1 and 2, it will still ask the user for the type of emotion or 
feeling they have to align themselves with specific shows they may want to watch, and choosing randomly from that section.

Now the genre's must match with that of MAL so there must be a check to ensure an applicable genre was chosen.

STEP 3(Warning!!)
As we know have a larger library of information to use, creating a list for the final showcase will not be manageable at a larger scale,
utilizing a data frame to more easily access the information will most likely be the better option. 

STEP 3(POSSIBLE ALT SOLUTION)
If you still wish to showcase the output of several shows, then it may be best to have a set amount, such as asking the user how many
shows they wish to be reccomended (1-10), and randomly select 1-10 shows based on the users preferences.

STEP 4
=================

Once the base of step 3 is completed. Allow the user to declare if a show has already been watched by them before, so it may
not be used within the selection. 

For shows the user has already watched, add towards a file that saves the shows name so if the user reruns the program. The information 
the user stated prior is saved. 

===========
Above will be the final version of the project within the console commands, below is implementing a web interface which will incorporate
much more broader knowledge of things. 

From here you can to go on to other projects, you can decide to either have this project remain in console form until you have
developed other projects which can also be utilized through a web interface. 

Below is very vague for now as I have not yet thought of a proper way or determined what is needed for the web version yet.
===========

STEP 5
=================

Potentially create a website that incorporates this functionality instead of it being done through the console.
